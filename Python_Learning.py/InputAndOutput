-->So far we’ve encountered two ways of writing values: expression statements and the print() function.
-->A third way is using the write() method of file objects; 
There are several ways to format output:
1.Formatting string literals:
    Begin a string with f or F before the opening quotation mark. Inside this string, you can write a Python expression between { and } characters that can refer to variables or literal values.
2.str.Format():
The str.format() method of strings requires more manual effort. You’ll still use { and } to mark where a variable will be substituted and can provide detailed formatting directives, but you’ll also need to provide the information to be formatted.
