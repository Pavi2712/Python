Python is an easy to learn, powerful(readability , versatile , easy to learn,cross platform) programming language.
Python is a Interpreted Language --> The code is executed line by line by the interpreter during runtime,without a separate compilation step.
Compiled --> The entire source code is translated into a machine code by a compiler before the program get executed.
Python is a dynamically typed language --> It allows variables to change their data type during runtime, meaning we don't need to define them explicity. Memory container is created and the value is stored .
Static Typing --> The data types are defined during compile time and cannot be changed during runtime, meaning we need to define them.
The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python web site --> pre-written modules and functions that are built into the core distribution which provides more functionalities for various programming tasks without requiring external installations.
Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++. 
Also, it can be a extensible language for customized applications.
Python Standard Library --> Python Language Reference describes the syntax and semantic of Python.
It will have the predefined modules and functions also, that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O.
Semantic --> Determines the meaning and behavior of the code.
Syntax --> Deals with the rules of the language.
