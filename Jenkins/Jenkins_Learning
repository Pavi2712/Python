1.Enter the Admin password
2.Once opening the local portal enter the username, password , mail id.
3.Install the nucessary plugins.
4.Jenkins Dashboard is opened.
5.Clicking on New Item we can able to create the build by configuring Github.

dir in windows
ls in linux

start - podman ps , podman exec -it jenkins container id
stop - stop

Steps:
1.podman pull jenkins/jenkins:lts -
2.mkdir d:\jenkins_home -
3.change the directory to jenkins_home
4.podman run -d --name jenkins -p 8080:8080 -v D:\jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home --user root jenkins/jenkins:lts
or 
4.podman run -d --name jenkins -P -v D:\jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home --user root jenkins/jenkins:lts
5.podman ps
6.podman logs -f jenkins
7.Open the portal.

How to schedule a job:
configure -> triggers ->Build Periodically -> schedule ->
Schule have time frames such as H/3 * * * * in jenkins , If we schedule for some time with any value * we have to stop that.
min hour day/month month day/week
* -->any value
, -->value list separator
- -->range of values
/ -->step values

Delete job
create the folder , put some jobs inside the folder. If u want to delete one job need to go inside the job and delete the job.
1.Create the pipeline - new item - pipeline
2.Replay If we want to run the failured job we should run inside the job - replay so it will not distrub other
build step and post build actions - predefined in freestyle but in pipeline we have to do

Need to learn groovy script

Pipeline:
top level of jenkins
we ask agent to do stage and steps
Structure for Pipelines: pipeline , agent , stages , stage (steps).

script:
pipeline{
    agent any
    stages{
        stage('checkout'){
            steps{
                git branch:'main', url: "project url need to mention" #branch - checkout
            }
        }
        stage('Install'){
            steps{
                sh"pip install python" #sh means shell script
                echo "pytest --env ${params.names}"
                echo "name: ${params.names}"
            }
        }
    }
}
apt-get -y upgrade --fix-missing #It will install all the missing packages
SCM - Source Code Management. Jenkins will connect to the SCM. Then pulls the jenkinsfile from the repo. It will reads and executes the stages and steps you defined inside the jenkinsfile.
Difference between below two:
podman run -it <image_id> - Creates a new container from the specified image and starts it interactively. (-it means interactive terminal.).When you want to start a new container from an image and interact with it.
podman exec -it <container_id> - Executes a command inside an already running container, interactively.When you want to run a command or get a shell inside an existing running container without starting a new one.

why we will use pyproject.tomal file instead of requirements.txt. What is mean by them.

what is wheel (pyproject.tomal)
poetry?
pytest-sugar what is?
What is mean by list view (all) and my view in (my pipeline views)while creating folder.


1.Pipeline template plugins need to be installed, and need to start and stop. - Done
SMTP , port , language , sub , receiver , 
manage jenkins ->system , system message , 
plugins - check editable -  email extension template plugin (2) need to download -> system check wheter it is avaiabek , Extended E-mail notifigation , SMTP server - smtp.gmail.com , type if we give HTML in des also same , port , default receiptent ,  Reply to List sender email , Maximum attachement why -1? , 

Freestyle - Configure  - post build options -editable post - build action ,Editable Email Notification
 no developer  - receipts

 Pipeline: 

 Instaed of stages we write post, and post will have catches. Post is the thing used to put some output.
deletedir - jenkins builtin function to delete the currect directory

post{
    success{
        emailext(
            subject:
            body:
            to
        )
    }
}


credentials : Need to add
25 , 587 


system logs - connection issue logs will be shown 
allure - test reporting tool, it will collect the test status in a pictorial representation(UI)
install pytest allure skipped - grey , green - pass , red - fail
tests -> test reults -> Allure Path(test results path)
sugar and beautiful soup.

after build 1 commit we can see that is monitoring
Homework: test folder create multiple sub folder,,, each folder have 3-4 files.
features -> used to identify repos, folder is easily for monitoring purpose

Allure -> install allure jenkin plugins -> add it -> tools - Allure commandline - give name for it (allure_results) - 2.34.0 -> Apply and save -> 

pip install allure

same path for the homewrk 3 builds

Runtest:
pytest -- allure-result  --trace || true

create report - jenkinsa



freestyle:
post-build action- path allure-results 


Allure:
Step 1: pip install allure-pytest in V.E
Step 2: Run the allure pytest to generate the allure-results
Step 3:
